        Dating back to 1392 BCE, the temple was built on the east bank of the Nile River.<br>
        The Luxor Temple was built with sandstone from the Gebel el-Silsila area, which is located in South-Western
        Egypt<br>
        This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone. It was used for the construction of monuments in Upper Egypt
        as<br>
        well as in the course of past and current restoration works.<br>

        <br> The Luxor Temple was built during the New Kingdom and dedicated to the Theban Triad consisted of Amun,<br>
        his consort Mut,and their son Khonsu. The focus of the annual Opet Festival,Its construction was begun<br>
        by Pharaoh Amenhotep III and was completed by Pharaoh Tutankhamun.<br>
        <br>
        From the Middle Ages,the population of Luxor had settled in and around the temple,at the southward end of the
        mount.<br>
        Due to this, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to
        15 metres in height.
