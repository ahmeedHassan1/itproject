            <h2>GIZA PYRAMIDS</h2>
            <p>The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and
                constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC),
                the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren)
                a few hundred metres to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or
                Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther south-west.
                The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tomb of pharaoh Khufu.

                It housed the body of the deceased and kept it safe.
                It demonstrated the status of the deceased and his family.
                It retained the deceased's place in society.
                It was a place where offerings could be brought to the deceased.</p>
